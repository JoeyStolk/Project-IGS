# Project-IGS
A project where I wanted to implement javascript in my websites. This website includes a tab with a map and pop-ups made using javascript.
Navigate to the tab 'Plattegrond' where you can see a map. Try clicking on a number on the map. A pop-up with information should pop up.
If you scroll down a little more you can also see buttons that include routes to the numbers (they represent stands where businesses show their newest equipment)
